ReuseLogic Nexus

Advanced OOP Solution for Godot 4.2 Created By "https://www.youtube.com/@whilefree"

The addon is going to be uploaded to Godot AssetLib when I make sure it's bug-free and ready to use.

Don't base your actual projects on it "yet". Or if you do, do it at your own risk.

This is the link to my YouTube Playlist where I upload and share my official tutorials for the addon:

Thank you for your support. Have a great Object Orientalization... :)

Installation Guide:

Add the "addons" folder to your Godot project directory, and place ReuseLogic Nexus files inside that folder. Keep it in mind that the folder containing the files must be named: "reuse_logic_nexus".
